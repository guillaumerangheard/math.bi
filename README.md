# math.bi v0.4

**math.bi** is an MIT-licensed, object-oriented, and configurable math library for [FreeBASIC](https://www.freebasic.net/), partly modeled after [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) and ECMAScript's [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) object. Its goal is to make math in FreeBASIC as fluent as possible. It supports **rational numbers**, **complex numbers**, **angles**, 2, 3, and 4-dimensional **vectors** (with the option to switch on polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates), **quaternions**, and **matrices**, as well as **typed arrays** (see my [types.bi](https://github.com/guillaumerangheard/types.bi) library).

Please note that it is based on a somewhat old codebase, so _some_ of types are still being (re)written. (I'm looking at you, quaternions.) It was also designed as part of a larger project, so it works seamlessly with my rng.bi and [easing.bi](https://github.com/guillaumerangheard/easing.bi) libraries.
