# math.bi
A configurable math library for FreeBASIC, (partly) modeled after GLM.

It implements real and complex numbers, angles, 2, 3, and 4-dimensional vectors (with the option to switch on polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates), quaternions, and matrices, as well as typed arrays for each type. Its goal is to make math in FreeBASIC as “fluent” as possible, which means a lot of operator overloading. (Please note that it is still a work in progress.)
